The most expensive listing is named Charming Downtown/Cap Hill Apt - Walk Everywhere!
	* the listing id is '14296973'
	* It is professionally managed by a place called Effortless Rental group 
	* Claims to give you $50 in lyft ride credits
	* there is a parking spot etc.
	* the apt is located in Cheesman Park
	* its a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom for $999 a day?
	* 8.45 reviews per month


This listing doesn't actually cost $999 though, under calendar its typically rented for 
between $95-$250 with an average price of $109.85 it sounds like low end is more common 
than the high price
select max(price) as max_price
	,min(price) as min_price
	,avg(price) as avg_price
	,count(*) as counts
from calendar
where listing_id ='14296973';

Since Calendar and listings didn't match up I wanted to see if this happend more than once 
and it turns out there are 20 listings with $9999 listed as their price, which I just 
realized may be a result of me neglecting to change the datatype after I removed 
the dollar signs from the data.

Now that price is an Integer there are two listings coming up as $10,000. 
looking at their calendars it seems that only 1 of the three listings 
posted but was never occupied
select *
from calendar
where listing_id ='24673859' or listing_id='26840749' or listing_id= '13523589';

Now I'm really curious what the highest price a listing was occupied for according the calendar
The actual listing is '15436226' as $7000 but these dates are in the future so i don't 
feel great about that. When I looked at the listing it is located in West Colfax and 
is currently under construction which explains the future dates
